# PKPD Modelling of Erlotinib (Tarceva)

Erlotinib is a type of targeted cancer drug, and is also known by its brand name Tarceva. It is used in clinical practice to treat metastatic non small cell lung cancer (NSLC), and in combination with the chemotherapy drug gemcitabine to treat advanced pancreatic cancer [1].

In this repository we are analysing and modelling the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) properties of erlotinib. In particular, we are analysing two preclinical studies, where the tumour growth inhibiting effects of erlotinib on patient-derived lung cancer tumours and cell line-derived vulva cancer tumours in mouse models have been investigated [2, 3]. The complete analysis can be found in the notebooks referenced below.
