## About

**Chi** is an open source Python package hosted on GitHub,
which can be used to model dose response dynamics.

All features of the software are described in detail in the
[full API documentation](https://chi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting started
### Installation

1. Install sundials

Chi uses the open source package Myokit to solve ordinary differential equations
and compute their sensitivities efficiently. Myokit does this using sundials' CVODESS,
which needs to be installed with:

- On Ubuntu:
```bash
apt-get install libsundials-dev
```

- On MacOS:
```bash
brew install sundials
```

- On Windows: No action required. Myokit will install sundial automatically.

2. Install chi
```bash
pip install chi-drm
```

 You can now use chi's functionality by importing it
 ```python
import chi
 ```

 ### Tutorials

 Tutorials and more detailed explanations on how to use chi can be found in the [documentation's getting started](https://chi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html) section.
