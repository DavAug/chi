        Returns the absolute path to a SBML file, specifying the tumour growth
        inhibition pharmacodynamic model introduced by Koch et al. in [1]_.

        In this model the tumour growth inhibition is modelled by an empirical
        model of the tumour volume :math:`V_T` over time

        .. math::
            \frac{\text{d}V_T}{\text{d}t} =
                \frac{2\lambda_0\lambda_1 V_T}
                {2\lambda_0V_T + \lambda_1} - \kappa C V_T.


        Here, the tumour growth in absence of the drug is assumed to grow
        exponentially at rate :math:`2\lambda_0` for tumour volumes below some
        critical volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}`. For volumes beyond
        :math:`V_{\text{crit}}` the growth dynamics is assumed to slow down
        and transition to a linear growth at rate :math:`\lambda_0`. The tumour
        growth inhibitory effect of the compound is modelled proportionally to
        its concentration :math:`C` and the current tumour volume. The
        proportionality factor :math:`\kappa` can be interpreted as the potency
        of the drug.

        Note that the critical tumour volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}` at which
        the growth dynamics transtions from exponential to linear growth is
        given by the two growth rates

        .. math::
            V_{\text{crit}} = \frac{\lambda _1}{2\lambda _0}.
