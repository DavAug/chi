    abstract = {Variability is an intrinsic property of biological systems and is often at the heart of their complex behaviour. Examples range from cell-to-cell variability in cell signalling pathways to variability in the response to treatment across patients. A popular approach to model and understand this variability is nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) modelling. However, estimating the parameters of NLME models from measurements quickly becomes computationally expensive as the number of measured individuals grows, making NLME inference intractable for datasets with thousands of measured individuals. This shortcoming is particularly limiting for snapshot datasets, common e.g. in cell biology, where high-throughput measurement techniques provide large numbers of single cell measurements. We introduce a novel approach for the estimation of NLME model parameters from snapshot measurements, which we call filter inference. Filter inference uses measurements of simulated individuals to define an approximate likelihood for the model parameters, avoiding the computational limitations of traditional NLME inference approaches and making efficient inferences from snapshot measurements possible. Filter inference also scales well with the number of model parameters, using state-of-the-art gradient-based MCMC algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). We demonstrate the properties of filter inference using examples from early cancer growth modelling and from epidermal growth factor signalling pathway modelling.},

abstract = {In this review we present ways in which translational PK/PD modeling can address opportunities to enhance probability of success in drug discovery and early development. This is achieved by impacting efficacy and safety-driven attrition rates, through increased focus on the quantitative understanding and modeling of translational PK/PD. Application of the proposed principles early in the discovery and development phases is anticipated to bolster confidence of successfully evaluating proof of mechanism in humans and ultimately improve Phase II success. The present review is centered on the application of predictive modeling and simulation approaches during drug discovery and early development, and more specifically of mechanism-based PK/PD modeling. Case studies are presented, focused on the relevance of M&S contributions to real-world questions and the impact on decision making.}

@article{Clerx:2019,
 abstract = {Time series models are ubiquitous in science, arising in any situation where researchers seek to understand how a system’s behaviour changes over time. A key problem in time series modelling is inference; determining properties of the underlying system based on observed time series. For both statistical and mechanistic models, inference involves finding parameter values, or distributions of parameters values, which produce outputs consistent with observations. A wide variety of inference techniques are available and different approaches are suitable for different classes of problems. This variety presents a challenge for researchers, who may not have the resources or expertise to implement and experiment with these methods. PINTS (Probabilistic Inference on Noisy Time Series — https://github.com/pints-team/pints) is an open-source (BSD 3-clause license) Python library that provides researchers with a broad suite of non-linear optimisation and sampling methods. It allows users to wrap a model and data in a transparent and straightforward interface, which can then be used with custom or pre-defined error measures for optimisation, or with likelihood functions for Bayesian inference or maximum-likelihood estimation. Derivative-free optimisation algorithms — which work without harder-to-obtain gradient information — are included, as well as inference algorithms such as adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling, which estimate distributions over parameter values. By making these statistical techniques available in an open and easy-to-use framework, PINTS brings the power of these modern methods to a wider scientific audience. Funding statement: M.C., G.R.M. and D.J.G. acknowledge support from the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council [BBSRC grant number BB/P010008/1]; M.R., S.G. and D.J.G. gratefully acknowledge research support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Cross-Disciplinary Interface Programme [EPSRC grant number EP/I017909/1]; C.L.L. acknowledges support from the Clarendon Scholarship Fund, the EPSRC and the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) [EPSRC grant number EP/L016044/1]; B.L. acknowledges support from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EPSRC grant number EP/F500394/1]; and S.G. and G.R.M. acknowledge support from the Wellcome Trust \&amp; Royal Society [Wellcome Trust grant numbers 101222/Z/13/Z and 212203/Z/18/Z].},
