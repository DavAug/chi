Welcome to Erlotinib's documentation!
=====================================

**Erlotinib** is a repository hosted on GitHub_, which enables users to analyse and
model the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PKPD) properties of the anti-cancer
drug *Erlotinib*.

Erlotinib is a type of targeted cancer drug, and is also known by its
brand name Tarceva. It is used in clinical practice to treat metastatic non small
cell lung cancer (NSLC), and advanced pancreatic cancer.

This page provides the API, or developer documentation for
`erlotinib`, the software used to analyse and model erlonitib's
PKPD.

While the package may also be used to model the PKPD of any compound, the `erlotinib` package
provides data and model libraries which are specific to Erlotinib (Tarceva).
