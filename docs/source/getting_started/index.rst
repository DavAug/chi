.. currentmodule:: chi

This part of the documentation gets you started using Chi. Each section will
give a brief introduction into the modelling framework and show examples of
how to implement models in Chi. The covered topics include **simulation** and
**inference** of e.g. ODE models, PKPD models with drug administration and
non-linear mixed effects models / hierarchical models.
