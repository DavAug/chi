        Returns an instantiation of a 1-compartment PK model.

        In this model the distribution of the drug is modelled by one
        compartment with a linear elimination rate :math:`k_e`

        the drug in the body, respectively. :math:`V` is the effective volume
        of distribution of the drug in the compartment.

        This model may be interpreted as modelling the blood plasma
        concentration of the drug, with the assumption that the clearance of
        the drug through the liver may be approximated by an exponential decay
        with the rate :math:`k_e`.

        through a dosing compartment.

        Returns the absolute path to a SBML file, specifying the tumour growth
        inhibition pharmacodynamic model introduced by Koch et al. in [1]_.

        In this model the tumour growth inhibition is modelled by an empirical
        model of the tumour volume :math:`V_T` over time

        .. math::
            \frac{\text{d}V_T}{\text{d}t} =
                \frac{2\lambda_0\lambda_1 V_T}
                {2\lambda_0V_T + \lambda_1} - \kappa C V_T.


        Here, the tumour growth in absence of the drug is assumed to grow
        exponentially at rate :math:`2\lambda_0` for tumour volumes below some
        critical volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}`. For volumes beyond
        :math:`V_{\text{crit}}` the growth dynamics is assumed to slow down
        and transition to a linear growth at rate :math:`\lambda_0`. The tumour
        growth inhibitory effect of the compound is modelled proportionally to
        its concentration :math:`C` and the current tumour volume. The
        proportionality factor :math:`\kappa` can be interpreted as the potency
        of the drug.

        Note that the critical tumour volume :math:`V_{\text{crit}}` at which
        the growth dynamics transitions from exponential to linear growth is
        given by the two growth rates

        .. math::
